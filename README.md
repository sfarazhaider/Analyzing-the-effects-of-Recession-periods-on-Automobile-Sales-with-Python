# Analyzing the effects of Recession periods on the Automobile Sales with Python

**Scenario**

The goal of this project is to create plots and visualizations to analyze "historical_automobile_sales" data to understand the historical trends in automobile sales during recession periods.
recession period 1 - year 1980
recession period 2 - year 1981 to 1982
recession period 3 - year 1991
recession period 4 - year 2000 to 2001
recession period 5 - year end 2007 to mid 2009
recession period 6 - year 2020 -Feb to April (Covid-19 Impact)

**Data Source**

The data is taken from the IBM course series for Data Analysis
https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DV0101EN-SkillsNetwork/Data%20Files/historical_automobile_sales.csv

**Data Description**
The dataset used for this visualization assignment contains historical_automobile_sales data representing automobile sales and related variables during recession and non-recession period.

The dataset includes the following variables:
1. Date: The date of the observation.
2. Recession: A binary variable indicating recession perion; 1 means it was recession, 0 means it was normal.
3. Automobile_Sales: The number of vehicles sold during the period.
4. GDP: The per capita GDP value in USD.
5. Unemployment_Rate: The monthly unemployment rate.
6. Consumer_Confidence: A synthetic index representing consumer confidence, which can impact consumer spending and automobile purchases.
7. Seasonality_Weight: The weight representing the seasonality effect on automobile sales during the period.
8. Price: The average vehicle price during the period.
9. Advertising_Expenditure: The advertising expenditure of the company.
10.Vehicle_Type: The type of vehicles sold; Supperminicar, Smallfamiliycar, Mediumfamilycar, Executivecar, Sports.
11.Competition: The measure of competition in the market, such as the number of competitors or market share of major manufacturers.
12.Month: Month of the observation extracted from Date..
13.Year: Year of the observation extracted from Date.
By examining various factors mentioned above from the dataset, we aim to gain insights into how recessions impacted automobile sales.

# The following are the Tasks for this project

**TASK 1: Develop a Line chart using the functionality of pandas to show how automobile sales fluctuate from year to year**

**TASK 2: Plot different lines for categories of vehicle type and analyse the trend to answer the question Is there a noticeable difference in sales trends between different vehicle types during recession periods?**

**TASK 3: Use the functionality of Seaborn Library to create a visualization to compare the sales trend per vehicle type for a recession period with a non-recession period**

**TASK 4: Use sub plotting to compare the variations in GDP during recession and non-recession period by developing line plots for each period**

**TASK 5: Develop a Bubble plot for displaying the impact of seasonality on Automobile Sales**

**TASK 6: Use the functionality of Matplotlib to develop a scatter plot to identify the correlation between average vehicle price relate to the sales volume during recessions**

**TASK 7: Create a pie chart to display the portion of advertising expenditure of XYZAutomotives during recession and non-recession periods**

**TASK 8: Develop a pie chart to display the total Advertisement expenditure for each vehicle type during recession period**

**TASK 9: Develop a countplot to analyse the effect of the unemployment rate on vehicle type and sales during the Recession Period**

TASK 10 Create a map on the hightest sales region/offices of the company during recession period
